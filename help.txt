All options take one parameter, except for those marked as a flag option.
Options can also be set using a custom config file (see `--config` option), in
which case, flag options, if set, can be unset by prefixing `no-` to the name,
for example, `--no-ssl` to explicitly disable SSL.

Upload Server Options:

  -h,  --host                Host/server to upload to. Prefix with `unix:` to
                             specify a Unix socket path.
                             SSL with Unix sockets requires NodeJS >= 0.12
  -P,  --port                Port to connect to (default 119 or 563 if `--ssl`
                             is specified)
  -6,  --ipv6                Connect over IPv6 (flag option)
                             Requires NodeJS >= 0.12
       --bind-host           Local address to bind to
       --tcp-keep-alive      If set, enables TCP keep-alive with the probe
                             interval set the number specified.
  -S,  --ssl                 Connect over SSL (flag option)
       --ignore-cert         Ignore SSL certificate problems
       --sni-host            SNI host name to send if connecting over SSL
       --ssl-ciphers         List of SSL ciphers to use, in OpenSSL format
                             See https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html for defaults
                             Requires NodeJS >= 0.12
       --ssl-method          Force SSL/TLS method. For details, see
                             https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html
  -u,  --user                Username to authenticate with
  -p,  --password            Password to authenticate with
  -n,  --connections         Number of connections to use (default 3)
       --timeout             Timeout on server responses (default 60s)
       --connect-timeout     Connect timeout (default 30s)
       --connect-retries     Number of connection retry attempts (default 1)
       --reconnect-delay     Delay connection retries (default 5s)
       --request-retries     Number of request retry attempts (default 5)
       --post-retries        Number of post retry attempts in response to 441
                             errors (default 1)
       --ignore-post-timeout Assume post succeeds when response times out (flag
                             option). If not set, will retry posting, up to
                             `--request-retries` attempts and then fail. If
                             set, timeout errors are ignored; note that
                             `--skip-errors post-timeout` will have no effect.
       --keep-alive          Try to always keep connection alive even if not
                             needed (flag option).

Article/Post Options:

  -a,  --article-size        Target size of each news post (default 750K). Note
                             that yEnc makes the actual size larger.
       --article-line-size   Max bytes per line (default 128)
  -t,  --comment             Comment to insert before post subject
       --comment2            Comment to append after post subject
  -F,  --group-files         Group files by filename, similar to how indexers
                             would see them. This only affects the file counter
                             placed in the subject (flag option)
  -s,  --subject             Subject to use for posts. The following
                             placeholders are available:
                                 {filenum}   Current file number in collection
                                 {files}     Number of files in collection
                                 {filename}  File's name
                                 {filesize}  File's size in bytes
                                 {part}      Article part number
                                 {parts}     Number of articles for the file
                                 {size}      File chunk size (before yEnc)
                             Default is similar to the following:
                                 {comment} [{files}/{filenum}] - "{filename}" yEnc ({part}/{parts}) {filesize} {comment2}
  -f,  --from                Shortcut for `-H From=...`
                             Defaults to 'username <username@host>'
  -g,  --groups              Shortcut for `-H Newsgroups=...`
                             Separate multiple groups with commas.
                             Defaults to alt.binaries.test
       --date                Override the Date header, Message-ID timestamp,
                             and timestamps for generated NZBs, with specified
                             date. This can be useful if you wish to expose
                             less timing information (or obfuscate your
                             timezone). Can use the special value 'now' to
                             refer Nyuu's start time. If unset (default), will
                             use the time at which each post is encoded. This
                             differs from 'now' in that it is not a fixed
                             timestamp across the whole run.
  -H,  --header              Specify an NNTP header in either of these forms:
                                 -H "MyHeader: MyValue"
                                 -H MyHeader=MyValue
                             This option can be specified multiple times. Note
                             that specifying the same header more than once is
                             currently not supported.

Post Check Options:

  -k,  --check-connections   Number of connections to use for post checking
                             (default 0). Set to 1 to enable checking. Higher
                             numbers of connections are only useful if post
                             checking is bottlenecking the rest of the proces.
                             You can prefix any of the options above, in the
                             "Upload Server Options" section, with `--check-`
                             to override that behaviour on these checking
                             connections, for example `--check-host` makes
                             Nyuu perform post checking on a different host.
                             `--check-post-retries` and
                             `--check-ignore-post-timeout` are unavailable as
                             no posting is performed on these connections.
       --check-tries         Maximum number of check attempts to perform.
                             A value of 0 disables post checking. (default 3)
       --check-delay         Initial delay after posting before performing
                             first check (default 5s)
       --check-retry-delay   Delay for check retries, if a check fails
                             (default 30s). Not used if `--check-tries` < 2
       --check-post-tries    Maximum number of attempts to re-post articles
                             that the post check could not find. Set to 0 to
                             disable re-posting articles (default 1)
       --check-group         Checking connections will be set to this group.
                             Some servers seem to want one set, otherwise
                             checking fails. If you set one, use a valid group
                             that you're not posting to, such as "bit.test"
       --check-queue-size    Max number of articles queued for checking.
                             Posting will stall if the number of articles to be
                             checked exceeds this number. Increase this number
                             to avoid these stalls, at the expense of higher
                             memory usage (default min(`--connections`*8, 100))

Other Upload Options:

       --skip-errors         Continue processing regardless of specified
                             errors. By default, Nyuu stops on all errors. You
                             can specify `--skip-errors all` to skip all
                             skippable errors, otherwise a comma separated list
                             of the following should be specified:
                                 post-timeout: post request timed out; if set,
                                               assumes post was successful
                                 post-reject: server rejects sent post; if set,
                                              assume post was successful
                                 post-fail: posting failed for any reason; if
                                            set, post is skipped
                                 check-timeout: check request timed out; if set
                                                assume check was successful
                                 check-missing: post checking fails to find the
                                                posted article; assume success
                                 check-fail: check failed for any reason; if
                                             set, assume success
                             Note that for requests that are retried (posting),
                             only the last result is considered.
                             Also note: Nyuu will exit with return code 32
                             instead of 0 if the process completes and errors
                             were skipped.
       --use-lazy-connect    Only create connections when necessary and prefer
                             using as few as possible (flag option).

NZB Output Options:

  -o,  --out                 If supplied, will write NZB to this file
                             Can be '-' which writes the NZB to stdout
                             Note: due to a bug in minimist, `--out -` will not
                             work, use `-o-` instead.
                             You can also pipe this into the stdin of another
                             process by prefixing a command with `proc://`, for
                             example: `-o 'proc://cat>out.nzb'`, which is the
                             same as using `-o- | cat>out.nzb`. The stdout and
                             stderr of the process is discarded.
  -O,  --overwrite           If NZB exists, overwrite it, otherwise will error
                             (flag option)
       --minify              Minify outputted XML (flag option)
       --nzb-compress        Compress outputted NZB. Can be gzip, zlib or
                             deflate. If node-xz is installed, xz is also
                             available.
       --nzb-compress-level  Compression level (0-9) to use. Default is 6
  -M,  --meta                Add a <meta> tag to the NZB. See `--header` option
                             above for syntax details.
       --nzb-encoding        Character encoding used in the NZB (default utf-8)

Advanced Tuning Options:

       --disk-req-size       Disk read request size (default `--article-size`)
       --disk-buf-size       Number of requests to read-ahead (default 1). Set
                             to 0 to disable read-ahead buffering.
       --post-queue-size     Max number of buffered articles for posting
                             (default `--connections`)
       --use-post-pool       Use a buffer pool to improve memory management.
                             Buffers are pre-allocated, which can also improve
                             performance, but can increase memory usage.
                             If not enabled, will rely on V8's GC to clean up
                             buffers. Default is enabled, and is a flag option.
                             Use `--no-use-post-pool` to disable the buffer
                             pool.

Other Options:

  -r,  --subdirs             How sub-directories should be handled, can be:
                                 skip: ignore nested files (default)
                                 keep: upload all files in sub-directories
  -l,  --log-level           Controls the output verbosity, value can be:
                                 0: completely silent (if command parsed)
                                 1: only show fatal errors
                                 2: show warnings
                                 3: show information (default)
                                 4: show debugging info
  -v,  --verbose             Alias for `-l4` (flag option)
  -q,  --quiet               Alias for `-l2` (flag option)
  -T,  --log-time            Add timestamps to log entries (flag option)
       --progress            Progress/status display control.
                             Value can be one of the below; if parameters are
                             needed, they are appended onto the end, separated
                             by a colon
                                 stderr: output a progress indicator to stderr
                                 log: output log entries every 60s showing
                                      progress. Interval can be changed via the
                                      parameter
                                 tcp: start a TCP server which will spit out
                                      status information on connect, then close
                                      the connection
                                 http: start a HTTP server which returns status
                                       information
                             For both tcp and http options, you can specify a
                             host:port. If unspecified, will default to
                             listening on all interfaces, on a random port.
                             This flag can be specified multiple times.
                             Default is `--progress stderr` if verbosity >= 3;
                             specify `--progress none` to suppress this.
                             Examples:
                               --progress log:30s
                                   Logs progress every 30 seconds
                               --progress http:[2001::1]:1234
                                   Start HTTP server on 2001::1 port 1234
                               --progress tcp:localhost
                                   Start TCP server on localhost on random port
  -C,  --config              Use a custom configuration file, see config.js for
                             an example
  -?,  --help                Display this help screen (flag option)
       --version             Print application version number (flag option)

Input Files:

  Additional arguments are taken as files to be posted. Directories can be
  specified as well, in which case all files inside are processed according
  to the `--subdirs` option above.
  
  Nyuu also supports piping inputs from a command, however, as yEnc requires
  knowing exact file sizes in advance, this will need to be specified. The
  syntax for specifying a process input is as follows:
  
    procjson://"[name]",[size_in_bytes],"[command]"
  
  After the prefix, this is actually a 3 element JSON encoded array, where the
  square brackets are optional.
  [name] refers to the filename that will be used, it is your responsibility
  to ensure that there are no duplicates. [size_in_bytes] is the exact size of
  the data to be emitted from [command], in bytes. [command] is the command
  that will be executed, and its stdout will be uploaded. The stderr of this
  process is discarded, and nothing will be sent to stdin.
  Note that quotation marks and some other special characters may need to be
  escaped with backslashes, as per JSON encoding rules.
  
  For example, here's an elaborate way to upload the 6KB image, trollface.jpg
  as moe_kyun.jpg (note that `cat` is assumed to be the utility to read a file
  to stdout):
    nyuu -h 0 'procjson://"moe_kyun.jpg",6144,"cat trollface.jpg"'

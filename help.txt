All options take one parameter, except for those marked as a flag option.
Options can also be set using a custom config file (see `--config` option), in
which case, flag options, if set, can be unset by prefixing `no-` to the name,
for example, `--no-ssl` to explicitly disable SSL.

This is a full list of options. Use `--help` to see a summarized version.

                             needed (flag option).

Article/Post Options:

  -a,  --article-size        Target size of each news post (default 700K). Note
                             that yEnc makes the actual size larger.
       --article-line-size   Max bytes per line (default 128)
  -t,  --comment             Comment to insert before post subject
       --comment2            Comment to append after post subject
  -F,  --group-files         Group files by filename, similar to how indexers
                             would see them. This only affects the file counter
                             placed in the subject (flag option)
  -s,  --subject             Subject to use for posts. The following
                             placeholders are available:
                                 {filenum}   Current file number in collection
                                 {files}     Number of files in collection
                                 {filename}  File's name
                                 {filesize}  File's size in bytes
                                 {part}      Article part number
                                 {parts}     Number of articles for the file
                                 {size}      File chunk size (before yEnc)
                             Default is similar to the following:
                                 {comment} [{files}/{filenum}] - "{filename}" yEnc ({part}/{parts}) {filesize} {comment2}
  -f,  --from                Shortcut for `-H From=...`
                             Defaults to 'username <username@host>'
  -g,  --groups              Shortcut for `-H Newsgroups=...`
                             Separate multiple groups with commas.
                             Defaults to alt.binaries.test
       --date                Override the Date header, Message-ID timestamp,
                             and timestamps for generated NZBs, with specified
                             date. This can be useful if you wish to expose
                             less timing information (or obfuscate your
                             timezone). Can use the special value 'now' to
                             refer Nyuu's start time. If unset (default), will
                             use the time at which each post is encoded. This
                             differs from 'now' in that it is not a fixed
                             timestamp across the whole run.
       --keep-message-id     Don't randomize Message-ID every time the post is
                             submitted. (flag option)
  -H,  --header              Specify an NNTP header in either of these forms:
                                 -H "MyHeader: MyValue"
                                 -H MyHeader=MyValue
                             This option can be specified multiple times. Note
                             that specifying the same header more than once is
                             currently not supported.

Post Check Options:

  You can prefix any of the options from the above "Upload Server Options"
  section, with `--check-` to override that behaviour on these checking
  connections. For example, `--check-host` overrides the `--host` parameter,
  making Nyuu perform post checking on a different host. `--check-post-retries`
  is unavailable as no posting is performed on these connections.

  -k,  --check-connections   Number of connections to use for post checking
                             (default 0). Set to 1 to enable checking. Higher
                             numbers of connections are only useful if post
                             checking is bottlenecking the rest of the process.
       --check-tries         Maximum number of check attempts to perform.
                             A value of 0 disables post checking. (default 3)
       --check-delay         Initial delay after posting before performing
                             first check (default 5s)
       --check-retry-delay   Delay for check retries, if a check fails
                             (default 30s). Not used if `--check-tries` < 2
       --check-post-tries    Maximum number of attempts to re-post articles
                             that the post check could not find. Set to 0 to
                             disable re-posting articles (default 1)
       --check-queue-size    Max number of articles queued for checking.
                             Posting will stall if the number of articles to be
                             checked exceeds this number. Increase this number
                             to avoid these stalls, at the expense of higher
                             memory usage (default min(`--connections`*8, 100))

Other Upload/Check Options:

       --skip-errors         Continue processing regardless of specified
                             errors. By default, Nyuu stops on all errors. You
                             can specify `--skip-errors all` to skip all
                             skippable errors, otherwise a comma separated list
                             of the following should be specified:
                                 post-timeout: post request timed out; if set,
                                               assumes post was successful
                                 post-reject: server rejects sent post; if set,
                                              assume post was successful
                                 post-fail: posting failed for any reason; if
                                            set, post is skipped
                                 check-timeout: check request timed out; if set
                                                assume check was successful
                                 check-missing: post checking fails to find the
                                                posted article; assume success
                                 check-fail: check failed for any reason; if
                                             set, assume success
                             Note that for requests that are retried (posting),
                             only the last result is considered.
                             Also note: Nyuu will exit with return code 32
                             instead of 0 if the process completes and errors
                             were skipped.
       --post-error-limit    If specified, and errors are being skipped with
                             `--skip-errors`, will limit the number of post
                             errors that are tolerated before aborting the post
                             process.
       --use-lazy-connect    Only create connections when necessary and prefer
                             using as few as possible (flag option).
       --on-post-timeout     A list of actions to take in response to a post
                             request timing out. Available actions are:
                                 retry: re-send the post (default
                                        `--request-retries` times)
                                 strip-hdr=X: remove the header "X" and retry
                                 ignore: assume post is successful and continue
                                         - no further actions will be tried.
                                         Note that `--skip-errors post-timeout`
                                         will have no effect if this is set
                             List is comma separated; after all actions have
                             been tried, the post will fail. If this option is
                             supplied, `--request-retries` will not be used for
                             posts. Example usages:
                               --on-post-timeout retry,retry,ignore
                                   Retry the post up to two times on timeout,
                                   then just assume success
                               --on-post-timeout retry,strip-hdr=User-Agent,retry
                                   1st timeout: retry post
                                   2nd timeout: remove the User-Agent header,
                                   then retry
                                   3rd timeout: retry post (header still
                                   removed)
                                   4th timeout: give up and throw error
                             Note: removed headers stay removed, even when the
                             post is re-posted due to a check failure.
       --check-group         Checking connections will be set to this group.
                             Some servers seem to want one set, otherwise
                             checking fails. If you set one, use a valid group
                             that you're not posting to, such as "bit.test"

NZB Output Options:

  -o,  --out                 If supplied, will write NZB to this file
                             Can be '-' which writes the NZB to stdout
                             Note: due to a bug in minimist, `--out -` will not
                             work, use `-o-` instead.
                             You can also pipe this into the stdin of another
                             process by prefixing a command with `proc://`, for
                             example: `-o 'proc://cat>out.nzb'`, which is the
                             same as using `-o- | cat>out.nzb`. The stdout and
                             stderr of the process is discarded.
  -O,  --overwrite           If NZB exists, overwrite it, otherwise will error
                             (flag option)
       --minify              Minify outputted NZB (flag option)
       --nzb-compress        Compress outputted NZB. Can be gzip, zlib or
                             deflate. If node-xz is installed, xz is also
                             available.
       --nzb-compress-level  Compression level (0-9) to use. Default is 6
  -M,  --meta                Add a <meta> tag to the NZB. See `--header` option
                             above for syntax details.
       --nzb-encoding        Character encoding used in the NZB (default utf-8)

Advanced Tuning Options:

       --disk-req-size       Disk read request size (default `--article-size`)
       --disk-buf-size       Number of requests to read-ahead (default 1). Set
                             to 0 to disable read-ahead buffering.
       --post-queue-size     Max number of buffered articles for posting
                             (default `--connections`)
       --use-post-pool       Use a buffer pool to improve memory management.
                             Buffers are pre-allocated, which can also improve
                             performance, but can increase memory usage.
                             If not enabled, will rely on V8's GC to clean up
                             buffers. Default is enabled, and is a flag option.
                             Use `--no-use-post-pool` to disable the buffer
                             pool.
       --preload-modules     Preload modules into Node's module cache before
                             starting (flag option). This is mostly a
                             workaround to Node's shortcomming of not being
                             able to load modules asynchronously. Usually is
                             slower, but may be useful if the CPU or disk is
                             overloaded.

Other Options:

       --dump-failed-posts   Write out articles that fail to post to this
                             location. Message-ID will be appended to this to
                             get the file name. This is a debugging feature
                             and should not be used unless needed.
  -l,  --log-level           Controls the output verbosity, value can be:
                                 0: completely silent (if command parsed)
                                 1: only show fatal errors
                                 2: show warnings
                                 3: show information (default)
                                 4: show debugging info
  -v,  --verbose             Alias for `-l4` (flag option)
  -q,  --quiet               Alias for `-l2` (flag option)
  -T,  --log-time            Add timestamps to log entries (flag option)
       --progress            Progress/status display control.
                             Value can be one of the below; if parameters are
                             needed, they are appended onto the end, separated
                             by a colon
                                 stderr: output a progress indicator to stderr
                                 stderrx: as above, but alternative format with
                                          more information
                                 log: output log entries every 60s showing
                                      progress. Interval can be changed via the
                                      parameter
                                 tcp: start a TCP server which will spit out
                                      status information on connect, then close
                                      the connection
                                 http: start a HTTP server which returns status
                                       information
                             For both tcp and http options, you can specify a
                             host:port. If unspecified, will default to
                             listening on all interfaces, on a random port.
                             This flag can be specified multiple times.
                             Default is `--progress stderr` if verbosity >= 3;
                             specify `--progress none` to suppress this.
                             Examples:
                               --progress log:30s
                                   Logs progress every 30 seconds
                               --progress http:[2001::1]:1234
                                   Start HTTP server on 2001::1 port 1234
                               --progress tcp:localhost
                                   Start TCP server on localhost on random port
  -C,  --config              Use a custom configuration file, see config.js for
                             an example
  -?,  --help                Display a summarized list of options (flag option)
       --help-full           Display this help screen (flag option)
       --version             Print application version number (flag option)

Input Files:

  Additional arguments are taken as files to be posted. Directories can be
  specified as well, in which case all files inside are processed according
  to the following option:

  -r,  --subdirs             How sub-directories should be handled, can be:
                                 skip: ignore nested files (default)
                                 keep: upload all files in sub-directories

  Nyuu also supports piping inputs from a command, however, as yEnc requires
  knowing exact file sizes in advance, this will need to be specified. The
  syntax for specifying a process input is as follows:
  
    procjson://"[name]",[size_in_bytes],"[command]"
  
  After the prefix, this is actually a 3 element JSON encoded array, where the
  square brackets are optional.
  [name] refers to the filename that will be used, it is your responsibility
  to ensure that there are no duplicates. [size_in_bytes] is the exact size of
  the data to be emitted from [command], in bytes. [command] is the command
  that will be executed, and its stdout will be uploaded. The stderr of this
  process is discarded, and nothing will be sent to stdin.
  Note that quotation marks and some other special characters may need to be
  escaped with backslashes, as per JSON encoding rules.
  
  For example, here's an elaborate way to upload the 6KB image, trollface.jpg
  as moe_kyun.jpg (note that `cat` is assumed to be the utility to read a file
  to stdout):
    nyuu -h 0 'procjson://"moe_kyun.jpg",6144,"cat trollface.jpg"' 

------------------
Examples

  nyuu -h example.com some_file
      Uploads some_file to the NNTP server at example.com

  nyuu -h news.example.com -S -u cat -p nyahaha -n3 -f 'Cat <eager-poster@computer>' -g alt.binaries.multimedia -o my_cat.nzb my_cat.mp4
      Uploads my_cat.mp4 to NNTPS server at news.example.com in group
      alt.binaries.multimedia. Upload is performed using 3 connections. 
      The from username is specified, and Nyuu will output an NZB, my_cat.nzb.
